Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I made a website about myself, which includes some fun facts about me and stuff I thought was interesting. It includes four pages, a main/home page, an
about me page, a page about fun facts, and a page called cool stuff which includes links and pictures I thought were fun. I included tables in the facts
page, lists on the about me and cool stuff pages, and images on the main, about me, and cool stuff pages.

You can switch between pages by using the bar below the banner at the top of the page. I outlined the bar using the grid model from Bootstrap, and the
links to other pages are contained in buttons using the Bootstrap button component layout. When the page is shrinked to tablet size, the buttons on the bar
become vertical and the title of the page is shortened using the @media query.

In the SCSS file, I included lots of formatting for the website. I used SCSS's variable to set a standard padding for body elements one the pages. I also
included nesting when I described my headers. Lastly, I used inheritance when specifying different elements of my table, which I wanted to be mostly
similar but slightly different.

I included many different CSS properties, such as background-color, height, font-weight, font-size, padding, margin, and more. I also included five CSS
selectors, elements, IDs, classes, grouping, and ::before (in the .html files).
