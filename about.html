                <p>
                    Hello! I am a third year astrophysics student at Georgia Tech! I'm from Virginia but I grew up
                    in Johns Creek, Georgia. My last year of high school, I took classes at Georgia State University,
                    where I started participating in astrophysics research. I studied ultrafast outflows from active
                    galactic nuclei and fell in love with research! I ended up going to Georgia Tech because it's close
                    to home and they have a good physics program! I started taking classes and getting involved
                    with campus life. After some initial struggles my first year, I was able to form a strong,
                    long-lasting friendship and get great grades and a good handle on life! &#128513
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            <p>
                Now, I am working on another astrophysics project at Georgia Tech that focuses on studying the
                characteristics of binary stars. I still love astrophysics and I can't wait to attend graduate school
                so I can continue to work on meaningful research and contribute to a field that I care so much about.
                After I get my PhD, I hope to either become an astronomer or work as a researcher with NASA. In my free
                time, I really enjoy musical theater, baking, and watching Netflix. I also love martial arts, and have
                been doing it for about twelve years. Currently, I manage the Hapkido Club at Georgia Tech, but I
                participated in American Karate for ten of those twelve years, so that's my favorite martial art.
